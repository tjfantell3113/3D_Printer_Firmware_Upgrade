# 3D_Printer_Firmware_Upgrade

This is the firmware code I use to run my 3D printer. The printer is made by HICTOP, and the model number is 3dp-12.
The firmware had to be updated after I upgraded the z probe to a bltouch, changed the extruder to a bowden extruder, and swapped out the bed plate for a glass plate.
